# In Details

- The dataset used in this work is [LibriSpeech](http://www.openslr.org/12/) (dev-clean version).

- I compared the performances in accuracy using different models of ML (Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive bayes, Support Vector Machine, Perceptron, Multi-layer Perceptron) and also a deep neural network (Convolutional Neural Network).
